<h3>What is dsml?</h3>

<p>dsml (Doesn't Suck Markup Language, pronounced "dismal") is a terse, simple markup language for when XML is simply overkill or overhead (so pretty much all the time).</p>

<p>dsml doesn't bother with types, schemas or other nonsense. It's simple, straightforward and most importantly, terse.</p>

<h3>Writing dsml</h3>

<p>dsml only has one type of element, the "node". In it's simplest form a node is simply a name. For example:</p>

<p><code>(mynode)</code></p>

<p>A node always has a name, may have attributes, and may have children or may have a value.</p>

<p>A node with attributes:</p>

<p><code>(mynode attr="value")</code></p>

<p>A node with a value:<p>

<p><code>(mynode "value")</code></p>

<p>A node with attributes and a value:</p>

<p><code>(mynode attr="value" "something")</code></p>

<p>A node can contain any number of child nodes. For example:</p>

<p><code>(mynode (node1) (node2) (node3))</code></p>

<p>An example with child nodes and attributes:</p>

<p><code>(mynode (node1 attr="value") (node2 (node3 "some value")))</code></p>

<p>A full example to configure some imaginary pieve of software:</p>

<p><pre>
(myapp version="1.1"
  (home "C:/Tools/MyApp")
  (install-date "20100712")
  (last-user-login "20100722")
  (screen
    (size "800x600")
    (resolution "1280x1024")
    (last-window-position x="100" y="24")
  )
)
</pre></p>

<h3>Parsing dsml</h3>

<p>In general, dsml users will simply point the dsml parser at an input stream, allow the parser to build a dsml model and then traverse the model. There are three model classes: <code>Document</code>, <code>Attribute</code>, and <code>Node</code></p>

<p><code>Attribute</code> is exactly what you think it is, a name/value pair. A <code>Document</code> represnts a dsml document, it simply wraps root nodes (note that unlike XML, a dsml document can have any number of "root" nodes, a document is therefore a forest of dsml trees). The <code>Node</code> class is the primary class for dealing with dsml documents. It provides access to a node's name, it's value (if it has a value), it's attributes (if it has attributes), or any children nodes (if it has child nodes). The <code>Node</code> instances merely represent a tree.</p>

<p>Parsing Example (DOM style):</p>

<pre>
  java.io.Reader in = /* Create a reader */

  ModelBuildingContext ctx = DefaultFactory.createContext();
  Parser parser = DefaultFactory.createParser();

  parser.parse(ctx, in);

  Document doc = ctx.getDocument();

  Writer writer = DefaultFactory.getWriter();

  writer.write(doc, System.out);
</pre>

<p>If you wish to take action as the dsml document is parsed rather than traverse the Document afterwards you can simply create your own implementation of ParseContext.</p>

<p>Parsing Example (SAX style):</p>

<pre>
  java.io.Reader in = /* Create a reader */

  ParseContext ctx = new MyCoolParseContext();
  Parser parser = DefaultFactory.createParser();

  parser.parse(ctx, in);
</pre>
